# Explanation:

This measure works like the Top-Risk SKU Forward Weeks of Coverage, but it calculates using Running Inventory,
which factors in current week inbound and demand. It starts by finding the running inventory for the current week,
checks upcoming weeks to see how much demand will reduce the stock over time. It keeps subtracting demand from the
running inventory until inventory reaches zero, then counts how many weeks that took.

The reason why there are two different DAX measures for FWC is because DAX measures are filter-context specific. In
Power BI, every visual applies its own filters based on the fields being used, which directly affects how DAX
calculations behave. Because of this, a single DAX measure can't always be used in multiple visuals if the filter
context is different. In this case, the matrix is filtered by Start of Week (Sunday) while the Top-Risk SKU matrix
is filtered by SKU + Description.
