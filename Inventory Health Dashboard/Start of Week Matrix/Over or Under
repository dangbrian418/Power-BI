Explanation:

This measure is another version of the Over/Under calculation, but it utilizes running inventory instead of On-Hand
Inventory. It takes the Running Inventory for the current week, then calculates the average demand for the next 13
weeks.
- If the inventory is within the minimum and maximum preferred stock levels, it outputs "Good"
- If the inventory is below minimum but there is no demand, it outputs "Under"
- If the inventory is above maximum but there is no demand, it outputs "Over"
- If the inventory is low and there is demand, then it calculates how many weeks it would take to restock up to the minimum
level
- If the inventory is high and there is demand, then it calculates how many weeks it would take to use up the extra stock
until it is below the maximum level

The reason why there are two different DAX measures for Over/Under is because DAX measures are filter-context specific. In
Power BI, every visual applies its own filters based on the fields being used, which directly affects how DAX
calculations behave. Because of this, a single DAX measure can't always be used in multiple visuals if the filter
context is different. In this case, the matrix is filtered by Start of Week while the Top-Risk SKUs matrix
is filtered by SKU + Description.
